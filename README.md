For this code, we are only interested in the **Places API** service on Google Maps platform.The Places API is a service that returns information about places using HTTP requests. Places are defined within this API as establishments, geographic locations, or prominent points of interest ([source](https://developers.google.com/places/web-service/overview)).

You need an API key to make any requests to google maps. If you don't have one, the following links give you information on how to get started. 

- [Getting Started with Google Maps Platform](https://developers.google.com/maps/gmp-get-started)
- [Get an API Key](https://developers.google.com/places/web-service/get-api-key)

Make sure the api key is restricted for only **Places API** (under API restrictions).
